# Equivalent stress

## Hosford equivalent stress{#sec:hosford}

The header `TFEL/Material/Hosford1972YieldCriterion.hxx` introduces
three functions which are meant to compute the Hosford equivalent
stress and its first and second derivatives. *This header is
automatically included by `MFront`*

The Hosford equivalent stress is defined by:
\[
\sigmaeq^{H}=\sqrt[a]{\Frac{1}{2}\paren{\absvalue{\sigma_{1}-\sigma_{2}}^{a}+\absvalue{\sigma_{1}-\sigma_{3}}^{a}+\absvalue{\sigma_{2}-\sigma_{3}}^{a}}}
\]
where \(s_{1}\), \(s_{2}\) and \(s_{3}\) are the eigenvalues of the
stress.

Therefore, when \(a\) goes to infinity, the Hosford stress reduces to
the Tresca stress. When \(n = 2\) the Hosford stress reduces to the
von Mises stress.

The following functions has been implemented:

- `computeHosfordStress`: return the Hosford equivalent stress
- `computeHosfordStressNormal`: return a tuple containing the Hosford
  equivalent stress and its first derivative (the normal)
- `computeHosfordStressSecondDerivative`: return a tuple containing
  the Hosford equivalent stress, its first derivative (the normal) and
  the second derivative.

#### Example

The following example computes the Hosford equivalent stress, its
normal and second derivative:

~~~~{.cpp}
stress seq;
Stensor  n;
Stensor4 dn;
std::tie(seq,n,dn) = computeHosfordStressSecondDerivative(s,a,seps);
~~~~

In this example, `s` is the stress tensor, `a` is the Hosford
exponent, `seps` is a numerical parameter used to detect when two
eigenvalues are equal.

If `C++-17` is available, the previous code can be made much more readable:

~~~~{.cpp}
const auto [seq,n,dn] = computeHosfordStressSecondDerivative(s,a,seps);
~~~~

## Barlat equivalent stress{#sec:barlat}

The header `TFEL/Material/Barlat2004YieldCriterion.hxx` introduces
various functions which are meant to compute the Barlat equivalent
stress and its first and second derivatives. *This header is
automatically included by `MFront`* for orthotropic behaviours.

The Barlat equivalent stress is defined as follows (see
@barlat_linear_2005):
\[
\sigmaeq^{B}=
\sqrt[a]{
  \frac{1}{4}\left(
  \sum_{i=0}^{3}
  \sum_{j=0}^{3}
  \absvalue{s'_{i}-s''_{j}}^{a}
  \right)
}
\]

where \(s'_{i}\) and \(s''_{i}\) are the eigenvalues of two
transformed stresses \(\tenseur{s}'\) and \(\tenseur{s}''\) by two
linear transformation \(\tenseurq{L}'\) and \(\tenseurq{L}''\):
\[
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
\tenseur{s}'  &= \tenseurq{L'} \,\colon\,\tsigma \\
\tenseur{s}'' &= \tenseurq{L''}\,\colon\,\tsigma \\
\end{aligned}
\right.
\]

The linear transformations \(\tenseurq{L}'\) and \(\tenseurq{L}''\)
are defined by \(9\) coefficients (each) which describe the material
orthotropy. There are defined through auxiliary linear transformations
\(\tenseurq{C}'\) and \(\tenseurq{C}''\) as follows:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\tenseurq{L}' &=\tenseurq{C}'\,\colon\,\tenseurq{M} \\
\tenseurq{L}''&=\tenseurq{C}''\,\colon\,\tenseurq{M}
\end{aligned}
\]
where \(\tenseurq{M}\) is the transformation of the stress to its deviator:
\[
\tenseurq{M}=\tenseurq{I}-\Frac{1}{3}\tenseur{I}\,\otimes\,\tenseur{I}
\]

The linear transformations \(\tenseurq{C}'\) and \(\tenseurq{C}''\) of
the deviator stress are defined as follows:
\[
\tenseurq{C}'=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -c'_{12} & -c'_{13} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
-c'_{21} & 0 & -c'_{23} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
-c'_{31} & -c'_{32} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & c'_{44} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & c'_{55} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & c'_{66} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\quad
\text{and}
\quad
\tenseurq{C}''=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -c''_{12} & -c''_{13} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
-c''_{21} & 0 & -c''_{23} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
-c''_{31} & -c''_{32} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & c''_{44} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & c''_{55} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & c''_{66} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

The following functions have been implemented:

- `computeBarlatStress`: return the Barlat equivalent stress
- `computeBarlatStressNormal`: return a tuple containing the Barlat
  equivalent stress and its first derivative (the normal)
- `computeBarlatStressSecondDerivative`: return a tuple containing the
  Barlat equivalent stress, its first derivative (the normal) and the
  second derivative.

### Linear transformations

To define the linear transformations, the
`makeBarlatLinearTransformation` function has been introduced. This
function takes two template parameter:

- the space dimension (\(1\), \(2\), and \(3\))
- the numeric type used (automatically deduced)

This functions takes the \(9\) coefficients as arguments, as follows:

~~~~{.cpp}
const auto l1 = makeBarlatLinearTransformation<3>(c_12,c_21,c_13,c_31,
                                                  c_23,c_32,c_44,c_55,c_66);
~~~~

> **Note** In his paper, Barlat and coworkers uses the following convention for
> storing symmetric tensors:
> 
> \[
> \begin{pmatrix}
> xx & yy & zz & yz & zx & xy
> \end{pmatrix}
> \]
> 
> which is not consistent with the
> `TFEL`/`Cast3M`/`Abaqus`/`Ansys` conventions:
> 
> \[
> \begin{pmatrix}
> xx & yy & zz & xy & xz & yz
> \end{pmatrix}
> \]
> 
> Therefore, if one wants to uses coeficients \(c^{B}\) given
> by Barlat, one shall call this function as follows:
> 
> ~~~~{.cpp}
> const auto l1 = makeBarlatLinearTransformation<3>(cB_12,cB_21,cB_13,cB_31,
>                                                   cB_23,cB_32,cB_66,cBB_55,cBB_44);
> ~~~~

The `TFEL/Material` library also provide an overload of the
`makeBarlatLinearTransformation` which template parameters are the
modelling hypothesis and the orthotropic axis conventions. The purpose
of this overload is to swap appriopriate coefficients to get a
consistent definition of the linear transforamtions for all the
modelling hypotheses.

# General functionalities

## \(\pi\)-plane

The \(\pi\)-plane is defined in the space defined by the three
eigenvalues \(S_{0}\), \(S_{1}\) and \(S_{2}\) of the stress by the
following equations:
\[
S_{0}+S_{1}+S_{2}=0
\]

This plane contains deviatoric stress states and is perpendicular to
the hydrostatic axis. A basis of this plane is given by the following
vectors:
\[
\vec{n}_{0}=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,
\begin{pmatrix}
1  \\
-1 \\
0
\end{pmatrix}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\vec{n}_{1}=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\,
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 \\
-1 \\
 2
\end{pmatrix}
\]

This plane is used to characterize the iso-values of equivalent
stresses which are not sensitive to the hydrostatic pression.

Various functions are available:

- `projectOnPiPlane`: this function projects a stress state on the
  \(\pi\)-plane.
- `buildFromPiPlane`: this function builds a stress state, defined by
  its three eigenvalues, from its coordinate in the \(\pi\)-plane.

# Orthotropic axes convention

Most finite element solver can't have a uniq definition of the
orthotropic axes for all the modelling hypotheses.

For example, one can define a pipe using the following axes
definition:

- \(\left(rr,zz,tt,...\right)\) in \(3D\), \(2D\) axysymmetric, \(1D\)
  axisymmetric generalised plane strain or generalised plane stress.
- \(\left(rr,tt,zz,...\right)\) in \(2D\) plane stress, strain,
  generalized plane strain.

With those conventions, the axial direction is either the second or
the third material axis, a fact that must be taken into account when
defining the stiffness tensor, the Hill tensor(s), the thermal
expansion, etc.

If we were to model plates, a appropriate convention is the following:

- The first material axis is the rolling direction
- The second material axis is the in plane direction perpendicular to
  the rolling direction (transverse direction).
- The third material axis is the normal to the plate.

This convention is only valid for \(3D\), \(2D\) axysymmetric, \(1D\)
  axisymmetric generalised plane strain or generalised plane stress.
- \(\left(rr,tt,zz,...\right)\) in \(2D\) plane stress, strain,
  generalized plane strain.
