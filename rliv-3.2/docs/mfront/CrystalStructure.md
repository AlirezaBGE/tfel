The crystal structure must be defined through the `@CrystalStructure`
keyword. This keyword is followed by one of the following value:

- `Cubic`: cubic structure.
- `BCC`: body centered cubic structure.
- `FCC`: face centered cubic structure.
- `HCP`: hexagonal closed-packed structures.

## Example

~~~~{.cpp}
@CrystalStructure FCC;
