# Release of versions 3.1 and 3.0.3 of `TFEL/MFront` (15/12/2017)

Versions 3.1 and 3.0.3 of `TFEL`, `MFront` and `MTest` has been
released on the 15th December, 2017.

## Version 3.1

A detailed version of the release notes is available
[here](http://tfel.sourceforge.net/release-notes-3.1.html).

### Highlights

From a user point of view, TFEL 3.1 brings many important features:

- The gallery is a list of detailed documentations about implementing
  clean, efficient and reliable mechanical behaviour using `MFront`
  that will be updated as TFEL and MFront evolve. In each case, the
  integration algorithm is fully described. The gallery currently
  contains \(17\) entries covering finite strain elasticity, finite
  strain viscoplasticity, damage, plasticity and viscoplasticity. The
  gallery. Those implementations are also gathered in a `cmake`
  projects called `MFrontGallery` which can be cloned on github:
  <https://github.com/thelfer/MFrontGallery>
- The integration of the `TFEL/NUMODIS` library which provides many
  functionalities associated with single crystal description coming
  from the [`NUMODIS` project](http://www.numodis.fr/). Those
  functionalities are available in `MFront` through many new keywords
  that simplify to a great extent the way small and finite strain
  single crystal behaviours can be written. See the following page for
  a detailled description:
  <http://tfel.sourceforge.net/singlecrystal.html>
- The `DDIF2` behaviour is used in CEA fuel performances codes to
  describe cracking of the nuclear fuel. The `DDIF2` brick allows this
  model to be easily coupled to the viscplastic behaviour of the fuel
  material and can be used as easily as the `StandardElasticity`
  brick. See this page for details:
  <http://tfel.sourceforge.net/ddif2.html>
- An important work has been devoted to enhance the overall numerical
  reproducibility and stability of the algorithms of `TFEL/Math`. It
  is now much safer to use the `-ffast-math` option in `gcc` and
  `clang` which can drastically increase the efficiency of the
  generated code. This option is automatically added when using the
  `--obuild=level2` option of `mfront`. See the release notes for
  details.
- Support for the Hershey/Hosford yield criteria which generalizes the
  Mises criteria. Indeed the Hershey/Hosford yield criteria lies
  between the Mises criteria and the Tresca criteria. Various
  functions have been introduced to compute the equivalent stress
  associated with this criteria, its first and second derivatives. See
  this page for details: <http://tfel.sourceforge.net/tensors.html>
- Support for the Barlat yield criteria which generalizes the Hill
  criteria. Various functions have been introduced to compute the
  equivalent stress associated with this criteria, its first and
  second derivatives. See this page for details:
  <http://tfel.sourceforge.net/tensors.html>
- Abritrary non linear constraints can now be defined in `MTest`.
- Better support of the Windows platform. Using the `cmake` generator,
  using `mfront` on windows with the `Microsoft` compilers is easy and
  closely follows the existing practices on other operating systems.
- Improved installation options. Two versions, or the same version in
  different flavours (compiled in debug mode, compiled with different
  compilers), of `TFEL/MFront` can now be installed in parallel.
  See <http://tfel.sourceforge.net/install.html> for details.

### Mechanical behaviours

#### New interfaces

Two new interfaces have been introduced in `MFront`:

- A native interface for the `CalculiX` solver. Here native is used to
  distinguish this interface from the `Abaqus/Standard` interface
  which can also be used within `CalculiX`. This interface can be used
  with `CalculiX` 2.13.
- An interface for the `ANSYS` `APDL` solver. The latter is still
  experimental.

#### The `@NumericallyComputedJacobianBlocks` keyword

Computing the jacobian of the implicit system is the most difficult
part of implementing a behaviour. Computing the jacobian by finite
difference is interesting but significantly decreases the performances
of the behaviour and can be (very) sensitive to the choice of the
numerical perturbation.

The `@NumericallyComputedJacobianBlocks` keyword is used select a list
of jacobian blocks that have to be computed numerically. This is more
efficient than computing the whole jacobian numerically. Combined with
the ability to compare the jacobian to a numerical approximation, the
user now has the ability to build the jacobian incrementally, block by
block and checks at each steps that their analytical expressions are
correct.

Portability is a convincing sign of software quality and
maintainability:

- usage of functionalities specific to operating
  systems are well identified.
- it demonstrates that the code is not dependant of the system
  libraries, such as the `C` or `C++` libraries.

`TFEL` has been tested successfully on a various flavours of `LinuX`
and `BSD` systems (including `FreeBSD` and `OpenBSD`). The first ones
are mostly build on `gcc`, `libstdc++` and the `glibc`. The second
ones are build on `clang` and `libc++`.

`TFEL` can be build on `Windows` in a wide variety of configurations
and compilers:

- native ports can be build using the `Visual Studio` (2015 and 2017)
  or `MingGW` compilers.
- `TFEL` can be build in the `Cygwin` environment.


`TFEL` have reported to build successfully in the `Windows Subsystem
for LinuX` (`WSL`) environment.

Although not officially supported, more exotic systems, such as
`OpenSolaris` and `Haiku`, have also been tested successfully. The
`Minix` operating systems provides a pre-release of `clang` `3.4` that
fails to compile `TFEL`.

#### Supported compilers

Version 3.1 has been tested using the following compilers:

- [`gcc`](https://gcc.gnu.org/) on various `POSIX` systems: versions
  4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2
- [`clang`](http://clang.llvm.org/) on various `POSIX` systems:
  versions 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0
- [`intel`](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-compilers). The
  only tested version is the 2018 version on `LinuX`.
  [Intel compilers 15 and 16](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-compilers)
  are known not to work due to a bug in the [EDG](https://www.edg.com)
  front-end that can't parse a syntax mandatory for the expression
  template engine. The same bug affects the
  [Blitz++](http://sourceforge.net/projects/blitz/) library (see
  <http://dsec.pku.edu.cn/~mendl/blitz/manual/blitz11.html>). Version
  2017 shall work but were not tested.
- [`Visual Studio`](https://www.visualstudio.com/) The only supported
  versions are the 2015 and 2017 versions. Previous versions do not
  provide a suitable `C++11` support.
- `PGI` compiler (NVIDIA): version 17.10 on `LinuX`
- `MinGW` has been tested successfully in a wide variety of
  configurations/versions, including the version delivered with
  `Cast3M 2017`.

#### Benchmarcks

|  Compiler and options    |  Success ratio    |  Test time  |
|:------------------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------:|
|  `gcc 4.9.2`             | 100% tests passed |  681.19 sec |
|  `gcc 4.9.2+fast-math`   | 100% tests passed |  572.48 sec |
|  `clang 3.5`             | 100% tests passed |  662.50 sec |
|  `clang 3.5+libstcxx`    |  99% tests passed |  572.18 sec |
|  `clang 5.0`             | 100% tests passed |  662.50 sec |
|  `icpc 2018`             | 100% tests passed |  511.08 sec |
|  `PGI 17.10`             |  99% tests passed |  662.61 sec |
: A comparison of various compilers and specific options

Concerning the `PGI` compilers, performances may be affected by the
fact that this compiler generates huge shared libraries (three to ten
times larger than other compilers).

## Version 3.0.3

This is mainly a bug fix version of the `3.0` series. Detailed release
notes are available [here](release-notes-3.0.3.html). There are no
known regressions.

# New entry in the gallery: perfect plasticity based on the Green yield criterion (30/11/2017)

![Comparison of the Green criterion \(C=1,F=0.2\) and the von Mises criterion](img/GreenYieldCriterion.svg "Comparison of the Green criterion \(C=1,F=0.2\) and the von Mises criterion in plane stress"){width=70%}

The Green yield criterion is based on the definition of an equivalent stress
\(\sigmaeq\) defined as follows:
\[
\sigmaeq=\sqrt{\Frac{3}{2}\,C\,\tenseur{s}\,\colon\,\tenseur{s}-F\,\trace{\tsigma}^{2}}
\]
where \(\tenseur{s}\) is the deviatoric stress tensor:
\[
\tenseur{s}=\tsigma-\Frac{1}{3}\,\trace{\tsigma}\,\tenseur{I}
\]

[A new entry](greenplasticity.html) in the gallery shows how to build
a perfect plastic behaviour based on this equivalent stress. The
implementation is available here:
<https://github.com/thelfer/MFrontGallery/blob/master/generic-behaviours/plasticity/GreenPerfectPlasticity.mfront>

# Barlat stress (24/11/2017)

Functions to compute the Barlat equivalent stress and its first and
second derivatives are now available in `TFEL/Material`.

The Barlat equivalent stress is defined as follows (See @barlat_linear_2005):
\[
\sigmaeq^{B}=
\sqrt[a]{
  \frac{1}{4}\left(
  \sum_{i=0}^{3}
  \sum_{j=0}^{3}
  \absvalue{s'_{i}-s''_{j}}^{a}
  \right)
}
\]

where \(s'_{i}\) and \(s''_{i}\) are the eigenvalues of two
transformed stresses \(\tenseur{s}'\) and \(\tenseur{s}''\) by two
linear transformation \(\tenseurq{L}'\) and \(\tenseurq{L}''\):
\[
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
\tenseur{s}'  &= \tenseurq{L'} \,\colon\,\tsigma \\
\tenseur{s}'' &= \tenseurq{L''}\,\colon\,\tsigma \\
\end{aligned}
\right.
\]

The linear transformations \(\tenseurq{L}'\) and \(\tenseurq{L}''\)
are defined by \(9\) coefficients (each) which describe the material
orthotropy. There are defined through auxiliary linear transformations
\(\tenseurq{C}'\) and \(\tenseurq{C}''\) as follows:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\tenseurq{L}' &=\tenseurq{C}'\,\colon\,\tenseurq{M} \\
\tenseurq{L}''&=\tenseurq{C}''\,\colon\,\tenseurq{M}
\end{aligned}
\]
where \(\tenseurq{M}\) is the transformation of the stress to its deviator:
\[
\tenseurq{M}=\tenseurq{I}-\Frac{1}{3}\tenseur{I}\,\otimes\,\tenseur{I}
\]

The linear transformations of the deaviator stress \(\tenseurq{C}'\)
and \(\tenseurq{C}''\), are defined as follows:
\[
\tenseurq{C}'=
\Frac{1}{3}\,
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -c'_{12} & -c'_{13} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
-c'_{21} & 0 & -c'_{23} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
-c'_{31} & -c'_{32} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & c'_{44} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & c'_{55} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & c'_{66} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\quad
\text{and}
\quad
\tenseurq{C}''=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -c''_{12} & -c''_{13} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
-c''_{21} & 0 & -c''_{23} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
-c''_{31} & -c''_{32} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & c''_{44} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & c''_{55} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & c''_{66} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

When all the coefficients \(c'_{ji}\) and \(c''_{ji}\) are equal to
\(1\), the Barlat equivalent stress reduces to the Hosford equivalent
stress.

The following function has been implemented:

- `computeBarlatStress`: return the Barlat equivalent stress
- `computeBarlatStressNormal`: return a tuple containg the Barlat
  equivalent stress and its first derivative (the normal)
- `computeBarlatStressSecondDerivative`: return a tuple containg the
  Barlat equivalent stress, its first derivative (the normal) and the
  second derivative.

The implementation of those functions are greatly inspired by the work
of Scherzinger (see @scherzinger_return_2017). In particular, great
care is given to avoid overflows in the computations of the Barlat
stress.

Those functions have two template parameters:

- the type of symmetric tensors used for the stress tensor
  (automatically deduced, but required if the second parameter is
  specified).
- the eigen solver to be used.

## Example

The following example computes the Hosford equivalent stress, its
normal and second derivative:

~~~~{.cpp}
const auto l1 = makeBarlatLinearTransformation<N,double>(-0.069888,0.936408,
                                                         0.079143,1.003060,
                                                         0.524741,1.363180,
                                                         1.023770,1.069060,
                                                         0.954322);
const auto l2 = makeBarlatLinearTransformation<N,double>(-0.981171,0.476741,
    							                         0.575316,0.866827,
    							                         1.145010,-0.079294,
    							                         1.051660,1.147100,
    							                         1.404620);
stress seq;
Stensor  n;
Stensor4 dn;
std::tie(seq,n,dn) = computeBarlatStressSecondDerivative(s,l1,l2,a,seps);
~~~~

In this example, `s` is the stress tensor, `a` is the Hosford
exponent, `seps` is a numerical parameter used to detect when two
eigenvalues are equal.

If `C++-17` is available, the previous code can be made much more readable:

~~~~{.cpp}
const auto l1 = makeBarlatLinearTransformation<N,double>(-0.069888,0.936408,
                                                         0.079143,1.003060,
                                                         0.524741,1.363180,
                                                         1.023770,1.069060,
                                                         0.954322);
const auto l2 = makeBarlatLinearTransformation<N,double>(-0.981171,0.476741,
    							                         0.575316,0.866827,
    							                         1.145010,-0.079294,
    							                         1.051660,1.147100,
    							                         1.404620);
const auto [seq,n,dn] = computeBarlatStressSecondDerivative(s,l1,l2,a,seps);
~~~~

# Hosford equivalent stress (17/10/2017)

![Comparison of the Hosford stress \(a=100,a=8\) and the von Mises stress](img/HosfordStress.svg "Comparison of the Hosford stress \(a=100,a=8\) and the von Mises stress in plane stress"){width=70%}

The header `TFEL/Material/Hosford.hxx` introduces three functions
which are meant to compute the Hosford equivalent stress and its first
and second derivatives. *This header is automatically included by
`MFront`*

The Hosford equivalent stress is defined by:
\[
\sigmaeq=\sqrt{\Frac{1}{2}\paren{\absvalue{\sigma_{1}-\sigma_{2}}^{2}+\absvalue{\sigma_{1}-\sigma_{3}}^{2}+\absvalue{\sigma_{2}-\sigma_{3}}^{2}}}
\]
where \(s_{1}\), \(s_{2}\) and \(s_{3}\) are the eigenvalues of the
stress.

Therefore, when \(a\) goes to infinity, the Hosford stress reduces to
the Tresca stress. When \(n = 2\) the Hosford stress reduces to the
von Mises stress.

The following function has been implemented:

- `computeHosfordStress`: return the Hosford equivalent stress
- `computeHosfordStressNormal`: return a tuple containg the Hosford
  equivalent stress and its first derivative (the normal)
- `computeHosfordStressSecondDerivative`: return a tuple containg the
  Hosford equivalent stress, its first derivative (the normal) and the
  second derivative.

## Example

The following example computes the Hosford equivalent stress, its
normal and second derivative:

~~~~{.cpp}
stress seq;
Stensor  n;
Stensor4 dn;
std::tie(seq,n,dn) = computeHosfordStressSecondDerivative(s,a,seps);
~~~~

In this example, `s` is the stress tensor, `a` is the Hosford
exponent, `seps` is a numerical parameter used to detect when two
eigenvalues are equal.

If `C++-17` is available, the previous code can be made much more readable:

~~~~{.cpp}
const auto [seq,n,dn] = computeHosfordStressSecondDerivative(s,a,seps);
~~~~

# Release of `TFEL` `3.0.2` (25/10/2017)

Version 3.0.2 of `TFEL`, `MFront` and `MTest` has been released on the
25th October, 2017.

This is mainly a bug fix version of the `3.0` series. Detailed release
notes are available [here](release-notes-3.0.2.html). There are no
known regressions.

# Behaviours for modelling mild steel (14/09/2017)

![](img/rusinek-klepaczko.svg ""){width=75%}

Thanks to Guillaume Michal, University of Wollongong (NSW, Australia),
several implementation of behaviours suitable for the description of
mild steel are now available:

- Three versions of the Johnson-Cook behaviour:
   - `JohnsonCook_s`: which describes strain hardening but does not describe rate effects,
   - `JohnsonCook_ssr` : which describes both strain hardening and rate effects.
   - `JohnsonCook_ssrt`: which describes both strain hardening, rate effects and adiabatic heating.
-  The Rusinek-Klepaczko law as described in: "Constitutive relations
  in 3-D for a wide range of strain rates and temperatures -
  Application to mild steels". A. Rusinek, R. Zaera and
  J. R. Klepaczko.  Int. J. of Solids and Structures, Vol. 44,
  5611-5634, 2007.

# Support for the total lagragian framework in `Code_Aster`

![](img/AsterTotalLagrangian.png){width=50%}

Thanks to M. Abbas, `MFront` finite strain behaviours can now be used
in the total lagragian framework in `Code_Aster` (called
`GROT_GDEP`). First tests confirm that the robustness and the effiency
of this framework are much better than with the `SIMO_MIEHE` framework.

# First tests of `MFront` in the `Windows` `Subsystem` for `LinuX` environment (3/08/2017)

![](img/CalculiX_MFRONT_WSL.png "")

After [`Visual Studio`](https://www.visualstudio.com),
[`Mingw`](http://www.mingw.org/) and
[`Cygwin`](https://www.cygwin.com/), there is a new way to get
`MFront` working on `Windows` !

Rafal Brzegowy have successfully compiled and tested `MFront` using
the
[`Windows` `Subsystem` for `LinuX`](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/)
(WSL). He was able to use `MFront` generated behaviours with
[`CalculiX`](http://www.calculix.de) delivered by the
[`bConverged`](http://www.bconverged.com/products.php) suite.

All tests worked, except some tests related to the `long double`
support in WSL.

# Official twitter account (1/08/2017)

A binary version of TFEL compiled for Cast3M 2017 is now available for
download on sourceforge:

<https://sourceforge.net/projects/tfel/files/>

# Non linear constraints with `MTest`

Arbitrary non linear constraints can be now imposed in `MTest` using
`@NonLinearConstraint` keyword.

## Applications

Abritray non linear constraints can be used to:

- Impose a constant stress triaxiality.
- Impose a constant first Piola-Kirchoff stress in a creep test
  described in finite strain.

## On the physical meaning of a constraint

A constraint \(c\) is imposed by introducing a Lagrange multiplier
\(\lambda\).

Consider a small strain elastic behaviour characterised by its free
energy \(\Psi\). In the only loading is the constraint \(c\), the
solution satisfies:
\[ \underset{\underline{\varepsilon},\lambda}{\min}\Psi-\lambda\,c \]

In this case, the constraint \(c\) is equivalent to the following
imposed stress:

\[
-\lambda\,\deriv{c}{\underline{\varepsilon}}
\]

If the constraint is \(\sigma_{xx}-\sigma_{0}\), where \(\sigma_{0}\)
is a constant value, the previous equation shows that imposing this

# [MFront Gallery] How to implement an isotropic viscoplastic behaviour with several kinematic variables following the Amstrong-Frederic evolution (27/03/2017)

![](img/IsotropicViscoplasticityAmstrongFredericKinematicHardening.svg "")

The implementation of an an isotropic viscoplastic behaviour with
several kinematic variables following the Amstrong-Frederic evolution
law is described
[here](isotropicplasticityamstrongfrederickinematichardening.html)

The behaviour is described by a standard split of the strain
\(\tepsilonto\) in an elastic and a plastic parts, respectively
denoted \(\tepsilonel\) and \(\tepsilonvis\):

\[
\tepsilonto=\tepsilonel+\tepsilonvis
\]

## Elastic behaviour

The stress \(\tsigma\) is related to the the elastic strain
\(\tepsilonel\) by a the standard Hooke behaviour:

\[
\tsigma = \lambda\,\trace{\tepsilonel}\,\tenseur{I}+2\,\mu\,\tepsilonel
\]

## Viscoplastic behaviour

The viscoplastic behaviour follows a standard viscoplastic behaviour:
\[
\tdepsilonvis=\left\langle\Frac{F}{K}\right\rangle^{m}\,\tenseur{n}=\dot{p}\,\tenseur{n}
\]

where \(F\) is the yield surface defined below, \(<.>\) is Macaulay
brackets, \(\tenseur{n}\) is the normal to \(F\) with respect to the
stress and \(p\) is the equivalent plastic strain.

The yield surface is defined by:
\[
F\paren{\tsigma,\tenseur{X}_{i},p}=\paren{\tsigma-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\tenseur{X}_{i}}_{\mathrm{eq}}-R\paren{p}=s^{e}_{\mathrm{eq}}-R\paren{p}
\]

where:

- \(R\paren{p}\) describes the isotropic hardening as a function
  of the equivalent viscoplastic strain \(p\).
- the \(N\) tensors \(\tenseur{X}_{i}\) (i\in\left[1,N\right]) are
  backstresses describing the kinematic hardening.
- \(\paren{.}_{\mathrm{eq}}\) is the Von Mises norm.

We have introduced an effective deviatoric stress \(\tenseur{s}^{e}\) defined by:
\[
\tenseur{s}^{e}=\tenseur{s}-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\tenseur{X}_{i}
\]
where \(\tenseur{s}\) is the deviatoric part of the stress.

The normal is then given by:
\[
\tenseur{n}=\deriv{F}{\tsigma}=\Frac{3}{2}\,\Frac{\tenseur{s}^{e}}{s^{e}_{\mathrm{eq}}}
\]

## Evolution of the isotropic hardening

The isotropic hardening is defined by:
\[
R\paren{p}=R_{\infty} + \paren{R_{0}-R_{\infty}}\,\exp\paren{-b\,p}
\]

## Evolution of the kinematic hardenings

\[
\tenseur{X}_{i}=\Frac{2}{3}\,C_{i}\,\tenseur{a}_{i}
\]

The evolution of the kinematic variables \(\tenseur{a}_{i}\) follows
the Armstrong-Frederic rule:

\[
\tenseur{\dot{a}}_{i}=\tdepsilonvis-g[i]\,\tenseur{a}_{i}\,\dot{p}=\dot{p}\,\paren{\tenseur{n}-g[i]\,\tenseur{a}_{i}}
\]

CEA and EDF are pleased to announce that the third MFront users
meeting will take place on May 30th 2017 and will be organized by CEA
DEC/SESC at CEA Saclay in the DIGITEO building (building 565, room
34). 

Researchers and engineers willing to present their works are welcome.

# Announcing the `tfel-plot` project

![](img/tplot.svg "")

The `tfel-plot` project is meant to create:

- a `C++11` library for generating `2D` plots based on the Qt library
  (version 4 or version 5).
- a drop-in replacement of `gnuplot` called `tplot`.

This project is based on:

- The [`TFEL` libraries](http://tfel.sourceforge.net).
- The [`Qt` framework](https://www.qt.io/) .

Compared to `gnuplot`, we wanted to introduced the following new
features:

- The ability to select a curve and modify its properties (color, line
  width, line style, etc..) interactively.
- The ability to use `tplot` from the command line.
- A widget that can be used in every `Qt` code.
- The ability to load `C` functions in shared libraries, such a the
  ones generated by the
  [`MFront` code generator](http://tfel.sourceforge.net).
- Usage of some features introduced by the `TFEL` project such as:
	- kriging interpolation.
	- the ability to differentiate functions using the `diff`
      operator.
- Support for themes.

More details can be found on the dedicated `github` page:

# [MFront Gallery] Description of the implementation of a simple orthotropic behaviour (27/01/2017)

A new example has been added in the gallery
[here](orthotropiclinearhardeningplasticity.html).

This example describes a simple orthotropic behaviour.

The behaviour is described by a standard split of the strain
\(\tepsilonto\) in an elastic and a plastic parts, respectively
denoted \(\tepsilonel\) and \(\tepsilonp\):

\[
\tepsilonto=\tepsilonel+\tepsilonp
\]

## Elastic behaviour

The stress \(\tsigma\) is related to the the elastic strain
\(\tepsilonel\) by a the orthotropic elastic stiffness
\(\tenseurq{D}\):

\[
\tsigma = \tenseurq{D}\,\colon\,\tepsilonel
\]

The plastic part of the behaviour is described by the following yield
surface:
\[
f\paren{\sigmaH,p} = \sigmaH-\sigma_{0}-R\,p
\]

where \(\sigmaH\) is the Hill stress defined below, \(p\) is the
equivalent plastic strain. \(\sigma_{0}\) is the yield stress and
\(R\) is the hardening slope.

The Hill stress \(\sigmaH\) is defined using the fourth order Hill
tensor \(H\):
\[
\sigmaH=\sqrt{\tsigma\,\colon\,\tenseurq{H}\colon\,\tsigma}
\]

The plastic flow is assumed to be associated, so the flow direction
\(\tenseur{n}\) is given by \(\deriv{f}{\tsigma}\):

\[
\tenseur{n} = \deriv{f}{\tsigma} = \Frac{1}{\sigmaH}\,\tenseurq{H}\,\colon\,\tsigma
\]

# New eigensolvers (23/01/2017)

The default eigen solver for symmetric tensors used in `TFEL` is based
on analitical computations of the eigen values and eigen vectors. Such
computations are more efficient but less accurate than the iterative
Jacobi algorithm (see [@kopp_efficient_2008;@kopp_numerical_2017]).

With the courtesy of Joachim Kopp, we have introduced the following
algorithms:

- Jacobi
- QL with implicit shifts
- Cuppen
- Analytical
- Hybrid
- Householder reduction

The implementation of Joachim Kopp have been updated for `C++-11` and
make more generic (support of all the floatting point numbers,
different types of matrix/vector objects). The algorithms have been
put in a separate namespace called `fses` (Fast Symmetric Eigen
Solver) and is independant of the rest of `TFEL`.

We have also introduced the Jacobi implementation of the `Geometric`
`Tools` library (see [@eberly_robust_2016;@eberly_geometric_2017]).

Those algorithms are available in 3D. For 2D symmetric tensors, we
fall back to some default algorithm as described below.

| Name                        | Algorithm  in 3D          | Algorithm  in 2D   |

| `GTESYMMETRICQREIGENSOLVER` | Symmetric QR              | Analytical (TFEL)  |
: List of available eigen solvers. {#tbl:eigensolvers}

The various eigen solvers available are enumerated in Table
@tbl:eigensolvers.

The eigen solver is passed as a template argument of the
`computeEigenValues` or the `computeEigenVectors` methods as
illustrated in the code below:

~~~~~{.cpp}
tmatrix<3u,3u,real> m2;
tvector<3u,real>    vp2;
std::tie(vp,m)=s.computeEigenVectors<Stensor::GTESYMMETRICQREIGENSOLVER>();

: Test on \(10^{6}\) random symmetric tensors in double precision (`double`). {#tbl:comp_eigensolvers_double}

#### Some benchmarks

We have compared the available algorithm on \(10^{6}\) random
symmetric tensors whose components are in \([-1:1]\).

For a given symmetric tensor, we consider that the computation of the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors failed if:
\[
\Delta_{\infty}=\max_{i\in[1,2,3]}\left\|\tenseur{s}\,\cdot\,\vec{v}_{i}-\lambda_{i}\,\vec{v}_{i}\right\|>10\,\varepsilon
\]
where \(\varepsilon\) is the accuracy of the floatting point considered.

The results of those tests are reported on Table
@tbl:comp_eigensolvers_double:

- The standard eigen solver available in previous versions of `TFEL`
  offers a very interesting compromise between accuracy and numerical
  efficiency.
- If very accurate results are required, the `FSESJACOBIEIGENSOLVER`
  eigen solver is a good choice.

# New hyper(visco)elastic behaviours in the MFront model repository (13/01/2017)

The implementation of the Ogden behaviour is now described in depth in
the following page:

<http://tfel.sourceforge.net/ogden.html>

This behaviour is interesting as it highlights the features introduced
in `TFEL-3.0` for computing isotropic functions of symmetric tensors.

This page uses the formal developments detailled in:

<http://tfel.sourceforge.net/hyperelasticity.html>

Concerning hyperviscoelasticity, a page describing a generic
implementation is available here:

<http://tfel.sourceforge.net/hyperviscoelasticity.html>

If you have particular wishes on behaviours implementation that you
would like to see treated, do not hesitate to send a message at
[tfel-contact@cea.fr](mailto:tfel-contact@cea.fr).

# MFront model repository (7/01/2017)

A page referencing examples of well written mechanical behaviours has
been created here:

<http://tfel.sourceforge.net/gallery.html>

For each behaviours, we will try to provide tutorial-like pages
explaining the implementations details (usage of tensorial objects,
special functions of the `TFEL` library, choice of the algorithms, and
so on...)

The first attempt is an hyperelastic behaviour already available in
`Code_Aster`: the Signorini behaviour. You can find the page here:

<http://tfel.sourceforge.net/signorini.html>

This is still under review, so corrections and feed-backs would be
greatly appreciated. The following behaviours are planned to be addressed:

- the Ogden hyperelastic behaviour which will show how we can compute
  eigenvalues, eigenvectors and isotropic functions of symmetric
  tensors.
- hyperviscoelasticity (a very small extension of hyperelasticity,
  indeed)
- simple plastic behaviours

If you have particular wishes on behaviours implementation that you
would like to see treated, do not hesitate to send a message at
[tfel-contact@cea.fr](mailto:tfel-contact@cea.fr).

# TFEL version 3.0 has been released the 16/12/2016.

From a user point of view, TFEL 3.0 brings many game-changing features:

- New mechanical behaviour interfaces to several finite element
  solvers (`Europlexus`, `Abaqus/Standard`, `Abaqus/Explicit`,
  `CalculiX`)
- The support of behaviours bricks.
- The ability to simulate pipes using a rigourous finite strain
  framework in `MTest`.
- The introduction of various accelerations algorithms used for
  solving the mechanical equilibrium when the consistent tangent
  operator is not available.
- The development of a stable API (application programming interface)
  in `C++` and `python` which allow building external tools upon
  `MFront` and `MTest`. This point is illustrated by the development
  by EDF MMC in the Material Ageing Plateform of a new identification
  tool which is particularly interesting.

Many improvements for mechanical behaviours have also been made:

- Definition and automatic computation of elastic material properties
  from external MFront files.
- Support for the automatic computation of the thermal expansion and
  swelling in the mechanical behaviour.
- Better support for orthotropic behaviours with the notion of
  orthotropic convention which affects various keywords
  (`@ComputeStiffnessTensor`, `@ComputeThermalExpansion`, `@Swelling`,
  `@AxialGrowth`, `@HillTensor` etc..).
- An initial support of non local mechanical behaviours.
- Time steps management from the mechanical behaviour.
- Consistent tangent operator support in the Cast3M interface.
- Easier computations of isotropic functions of symmetric tensors and
  their derivatives.
- New material properties interfaces for various programming languages
  (`fortran03`, `java`, `GNU/Octave`).

A detailed version of the release notes is available
[here](http://tfel.sourceforge.net/release-notes-3.0.html).

# A new behaviour implementation, called `UnilateralMazars` (1 June 2016)

![](img/UnilateralMazars.svg "")

A new behaviour implementation has been submitted by F. Hamon (EDF R&D

- The `AxialGrowth` entry was added to the glossary

A full description of the 2.0.3 release can be found
[here](documents/tfel/tfel-2.0.3.pdf) (in french).

# Introducting `mfront-doc` (19 August 2015)

`mfront-doc` allows the user to extract the documentation out of
`MFront` file. `mfront-doc` generates files in `pandoc`
[markdown format](http://pandoc.org/demo/example9/pandocs-markdown.html). Those
files can be processed using [`pandoc`](http://pandoc.org/) and be
converted to one of the many file format supported by
[`pandoc`](http://pandoc.org/), including
[`LaTeX`](www.latex-project.org), `html` or various Word processor
formats: Microsoft Word
[docx](http://www.microsoft.com/interop/openup/openxml/default.aspx),
OpenOffice/LibreOffice
[ODT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument).

`mfront-doc` is developped in the 3.0.x branche of `TFEL`. A overview
of the `mfront-doc` functionalities can be found
[here](mfront-doc.html).

# New documentations pages (18 August 2015)

New documentation pages were added to describe the `MTest` and

# New interfaces for material properties (July 2015)

The current development version of `MFront` includes two new
interfaces for material properties:

- `java` designed for the
  [`java` language](http://www.oracle.com/fr/java/overview/index.html).
- `octave` designed for
  [`GNU Octave`](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) which is a
  high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for numerical
  computations.

Here is an example of a
[`GNU Octave`](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) session used to
compute the Young Modulus of uranium-plutonium carbide \(UPuC\) for
various porosities over a range of temperatures:

~~~~ {.octave}
octave:1> T=[300:100:1500]
T =
    300    400    500    600    700    800    900   1000   1100   1200   1300   1400   1500
octave:2> y01=UPuC_YoungModulus(T,0.1)
y01 =
   1.7025e+11   1.6888e+11   1.6752e+11   1.6616e+11   1.6480e+11   1.6344e+11   1.6207e+11   1.6071e+11   1.5935e+11   1.5799e+11   1.5662e+11   1.5526e+11   1.5390e+11
octave:3> y02=UPuC_YoungModulus(T,0.2)
y02 =
   1.1853e+11   1.1758e+11   1.1663e+11   1.1568e+11   1.1474e+11   1.1379e+11   1.1284e+11   1.1189e+11   1.1094e+11   1.0999e+11   1.0905e+11   1.0810e+11   1.0715e+11

# A "publications" page has been added to the website (July 2015)

The number of papers in which `MFront` is used is increasing. A
dedicated page has been added [here](publications.html).

If you publish papers which refers to `MFront`, please consider
contributing to this page.

# The paper entitled "Introducing the open-source MFront code generator ..." has been accepted for publication in Computers and Mathematics with Applications (24 june 2015)

The first paper dedicated to `MFront`, written by Thomas Helfer, Bruno
Michel, Jean-Michel Proix, Maxime Salvo, JÃ©rÃ´me Sercombe, and Michel
Casella, has been accepted Computers and Mathematics with
Applications. The paper is available online on the sciencedirect
website:

 > The PLEIADES software environment is devoted to the
 > thermomechanical simulation of nuclear fuel elements behaviour
 > under irradiation. This platform is co-developed in the framework
 > of a research cooperative program between ÃlectricitÃ© de France
 > (EDF), AREVA and the French Atomic Energy Commission
 > (CEA). As many thermomechanical solvers are used within the
 > platform, one of the PLEAIADESâs main challenge is to propose a
 > unified software environment for capitalisation of material
 > knowledge coming from research and development programs on various
 > nuclear systems.
 >
 > This paper introduces a tool called mfront which is basically a
 > code generator based on C++ (Stroustrup and Eberhardt,
 > 2004). Domain specific languages are provided which were designed
 > to simplify the implementations of new material properties,
 > mechanical behaviours and simple material models. mfront was
 > recently released under the GPL open-source licence and is
 > available on its web site: http://tfel.sourceforge.net/.
 >
 > The authors hope that it will prove useful for researchers and
 > engineers, in particular in the field of solid mechanics. mfront
 > interfaces generate code specific to each solver and language
 > considered.
 > 
 > In this paper, after a general overview of mfront functionalities,
 > a particular focus is made on mechanical behaviours which are by
 > essence more complex and may have significant impact on the
 > numerical performances of mechanical simulations. mfront users can
 > describe all kinds of mechanical phenomena, such as
 > viscoplasticity, plasticity and damage, for various types of
 > mechanical behaviour (small strain or finite strain behaviour,
 > cohesive zone models). Performance benchmarks, performed using the
 > Code-Aster finite element solver, show that the code generated
 > using mfront is in most cases on par or better than the behaviour
 > implementations written in fortran natively available in this
 > solver. The material knowledge management strategy that was set up
 > within the PLEIADES platform is briefly discussed. A material
 > database named sirius proposes a rigorous material verification
 > workflow.
 > 
 > We illustrate the use of mfront through two case of studies: a
 > simple FFC single crystal viscoplastic behaviour and the
 > implementation of a recent behaviour for the fuel material which
 > describes various phenomena: fuel cracking, plasticity and
 > viscoplasticity.

# Beta release of tfel-2.0.1 for `Windows 64bits` and `Cast3M 2014` (18 November 2014)

![TFEL and Cast3M 2014 on Windows 7 64 bits](img/Win64.png
 "TFEL and Cast3M 2014 on Windows 7 64 bits")

A beta version of tfel-2.0.1 for `Windows 64bits` and [`Cast3M`](http://www-cast3m.cea.fr) `2014`
has been released. A binary installer is provided
[here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tfel/files/Devel/Cast3M-2014/).

Installing this version requires a functional installation of
[`Cast3M`](http://www-cast3m.cea.fr) \(2014\) (which shall be
[patched](downloads/patchs-Cast3M-2014.tar.bz2) to call external
libraries) and the `MSYS` shell (It is recommended not to install
`mingw` compilers along with the `MSYS` shell as [`Cast3M`](http://www-cast3m.cea.fr) provides its
own version of those compilers).

Installation instructions of those requirements are available
[here](install-windows.html).

Any feedback would be gratefully acknowledge.

**Note:** The binary provided requires the `mingw` libraries delivered
with [`Cast3M`](http://www-cast3m.cea.fr) `2014`. 

**Note:** A standalone version of tfel-2.0.1 will be provided shortly.
