 * \section Tensorial Tensorial objects
 *
 * The `TFEL/Math` library provides two classes for second order
 * tensors:
 * - The `stensor` class which describes *symmetric* second order
 *   tensors.
 * - The `tensor` class which describes general second order
 *   (symmetric and unsymmetric) tensors.
 *
 * Fourth order tensors are linear transformations of second order
 * tensors.

 * The `C99` standard defines the `fpclassify`, `isnan`, `isfinite`
 * functions to query some information about double precision
 * floatting-point numbers (`double`):
 * 
 * - Following the `IEEE754` standard, the `fpclassify` categorizes a
 *   floating point number into one of the following categories: zero,
 *   subnormal, normal, infinite, NaN (Not a Number). The return value
 *   returned for each category is respectively `FP_ZERO`,
 *   `FP_SUBNORMAL`, `FP_NORMAL`, `FP_INFINITE` and `FP_NaN`.
 * - The `isnan` function returns a boolean stating if its argument has a
 *   not-a-number (NaN) value.
 * - The `isfinite` function returns true if its argument falls into one
 *   of the following categories: zero, subnormal or normal.
 * 
 * The `C++11` provides a set of overload for single precision (`float`)
 * and extended precision (`long double`) floatting-point numbers.
 * 
 * Those functions are very handy to check the validity of a
 * computation. However, those functions are not compatible with the use
 * of the `-ffast-math` option of the `GNU` compiler which also implies
 * the `-ffinite-math-only` option. This latter option allows
 * optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that assume that arguments
 * and results are finite numbers. As a consequence, when this option is
 * enabled, the previous functions does not behave as expected. For
 * example, `isnan` always returns false, whatever the value of its
 * argument.
 * 
 * To overcome this issue, we have introduced in `TFEL/Math` the
 * implementation of these functions provided by the `musl`
 * library. Those implementations are compatible with the `-ffast-math`
 * option of the `GNU` compiler. Those implementations are defined in the
 * `TFEL/Math/General/IEEE754.hxx` header file in the
 * `tfel::math::ieee754` namespace.
