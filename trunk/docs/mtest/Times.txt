The @Times keywords let the user specify a list of times used for the
computations.

This keywords is followed by an array describing intervals of
times. By default, one time step is used to go from a given time to
the next one. The keyword 'in' allows the user to divide an interval
into a given number of smaller intervals.

Note: the loadings and the external state variables evolutions are
described in a totally indenpendant manner (see the @ImposedStrain,
the @ImposedStress and the @ExternalStateVariable keywords).

Note: in case of non convergence, the algorithm handles time sub
steppings. See the @MaximumNumberOfSubSteps for details.

Exemple:
@Times {0.,3600.};         // 1  time step of  3600. seconds
Exemple:
@Times {0.,3600. in 10};   // 10 time steps of 360   seconds
