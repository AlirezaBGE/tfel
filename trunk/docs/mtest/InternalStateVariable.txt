The @InternalStateVariable keyword defines the inital value of a state
variable.

This keyword must be followed by the name of the internal state
variable considered, given as a string.

If this internal state variable is scalar, a real value is then
expected.

If this internal state variable is a symmetric tensor, an array of
real values of the appropriate size is expected. A symmetric tensor
has 3 components in 1D, 4 components in 2D and 6 components in 3D (see
the @ModellingHypothesis keyword). The off-diagonals components shall
be declared with a sqrt(2) factor.

Example:
@InternalStateVariable 'ElasticStrain' {'EELRR0','EELZZ0','EELZZ0',0.};
