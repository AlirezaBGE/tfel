The @Behaviour keyword declares the behaviour used for the test. This
keyword must be followed by an option specifying the interface used by
the behaviour. The umat and aster interfaces are both supported.

Two strings are then expected:
- the library in which the behaviour is implemented;
- the name of the function.

Example:
@Behaviour<umat> 'libMFrontCastemBehaviours.so' 'umatnorton';
