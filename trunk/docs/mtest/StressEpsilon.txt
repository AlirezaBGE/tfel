The global algorithm uses two criteria to check if a satisfying
equilibrium has been found: one on strains, the other on stresses.

This criterium on stresses checks that the residual of the Newton
Algorithm is low enought. By default, this value is equal to 1.e-3,
which is a convenient value if stresses are expressed in MPa.

The @StressEpsilon let the user specifiy the criterium value used for
the criterium on stressess.

It is followed by the criterium value.

Exemple:
@StressEpsilon 1.e2;
