The @MaximumNumberOfSubSteps let the user specify the maximum number
of sub steps allowed.

This keyword is followed by an integer.

When the global algorithm fails to reach equilibrium (see the
@MaximumNumberOfIterations keyword), the time step can be divided by
two. The maximal number of times the time step is reduced if given by
maximum number of sub steps.

Example:
@MaximumNumberOfSubSteps 10;
