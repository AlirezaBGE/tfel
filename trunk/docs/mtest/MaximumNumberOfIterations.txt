The @MaximumNumberOfIterations let the user specify the maximum number
of iterations of the global algorithm to reach the equilibrium.

This keyword is followed by an integer.

If the number of iterations reaches the maximal authorized value, the
time step is divided by two.

Example:
@MaximumNumberOfIterations 10;
