The `@ResidualEpsilon` keyword allows to change the yield value
\(\sigma_{\varepsilon}\) used in the criterion on the residual
\(\vec{\mathbb{R}}\), i.e. the difference between inner forces and
external forces as described in the reference manual of `PTest`.

More precisely, this criterion yields:

\[
\norm{\vec{\mathbb{R}}}_{\infty}<\sigma_{\varepsilon}\,2\,\pi\,R^{e}_{0}
\]

where \(R^{e}_{0}\) is the initial outer radius of the pipe.
