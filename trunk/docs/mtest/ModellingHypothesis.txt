The @ModellingHypothesis allows the user to choose the modelling
hypothesis to use. The keywords shall be one of the first keyword of
the file: if not, some keywords, which requires the modelling
hypothesis to be defined, may force the default modelling hypothesis
to be used (Tridimensional).

This keyword is followed by the desired modelling hypothesis given as
a string. The following values are currently supported:
- AxisymmetricalGeneralisedPlaneStrain (1D)
- Axisymmetrical         (2D)
- PlaneStress            (2D)
- PlaneStrain            (2D)
- GeneralisedPlaneStrain (2D)
- Tridimensional         (3D)

The modelling hypothesis changes the name of the components of
symmetric tensors and their numbers. For example, the components of
the strains are:
- AxisymmetricalGeneralisedPlaneStrain : ERR EZZ ETT
- Axisymmetrical                       : ERR EZZ ETT ERZ
- PlaneStress                          : EXX EYY EZZ EXY
- PlaneStrain                          : EXX EYY EZZ EXY
- GeneralisedPlaneStrain               : EXX EYY EZZ EXY
- Tridimensional                       : EXX EYY EZZ EXY EXZ EYZ

Note: The aster interface currently don't make use of the modelling
hypothesis. For this interface, this keyword only changes the spatial
dimension.
