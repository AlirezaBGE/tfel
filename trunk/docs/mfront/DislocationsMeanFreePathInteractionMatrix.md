The interaction matrix associated with the effects of the dislocations
on the mean free path of the dislocations of a specific system can be
defined though the `@DislocationsMeanFreePathInteractionMatrix`
keyword.

This keyword follows the same conventions than the
`@InteractionMatrix` keyword. In particular, the structure of the
matrix is fully described in the description of `@InteractionMatrix`.

See the `@InteractionMatrix` keyword for details.
